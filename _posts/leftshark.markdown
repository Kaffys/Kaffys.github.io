###Left Shark - Can he be copyrighted?

#Superb Owl
This year's Super Bowl was another huge another extravaganza. With advertisements selling for millions of dollars apiece, over 100 million viewers tuning in and players with millions of dollars worth of contracts and prizes on the line, it's anything but a minor production. There were many stars of this game, Richard Sherman of the Seattle Seahawks, Tom Brady of the New England Patriots and even the stunning half time performance by pop-singer Katy Perry. But the true star of the game was someone in a giant shark costume. He has been dubbed by his adoring fans as "The Left Shark", pictured below.
