This is the end of my 4 years at RIT. Yesterday, I went to my last class of my undergraduate career, and next week I will be walking across the stage to receive my diploma. Senior year was a roller coaster. I was the President of the largest club on campus, I was able to represent my peers at their Senator in Student Government, and I joined a large group of women in Sigma Sigma Sigma. I took classes that interested me, such as classes about Free and Open Source software, where I learned about a different aspect of Software development, or classes like Production studio, where I learned how to be a team leader.
