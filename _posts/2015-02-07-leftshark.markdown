#Superb Owl
This year's Super Bowl was another huge another extravaganza. With advertisements selling for millions of dollars apiece, over 100 million viewers tuning in and (American) football players with millions of dollars worth of contracts and prizes on the line, it's anything but a minor production. There were many stars of this game, Richard Sherman of the Seattle Seahawks, MVP Tom Brady of the New England Patriots and even the stunning half time performance by pop-singer Katy Perry. But the true star of the game was someone in a giant shark costume. He has been dubbed by his adoring fans as "The Left Shark", pictured below. The Patriots may have won this years Super Bowl, but the Left Shark will be the real champion.

There are IndieGoGos selling Left Shark costume, valentines day cards to give to your lovers, and of course Left Shark stickers. One of Left Shark's fans [Fernando Sosa](http://www.shapeways.com/shops/amznfx) created a beautiful 3D model, and posted is on the website Shapeways, a website where you can buy 3D printed models, so that every fan can have their very own shark. But recently, Shapeways has received a cease and desist letter from Katy Perry's legal team. Which you can download and read [here](http://kaffys.github.io/leftshark.pdf)

#Can they do this?
So Katy Perry and her team are claiming copyright on the shark costume. Is that within their rights? In addition to that, does Katy Perry even legally own that copyright?

There was a court case in 1987 called Brandir International, Inc vs Cascade Pacific Lumber Co. Brandir designed an award winning metal bike rack, Cascade began to copy the bike rack, and Brandir sued for copyright infringement. Cascade used the argument that because they were not works of art, they are useful articles and could not be copyrighted. The court ruled that:

>"If design elements reflect a merger of aesthetic and functional considerations, the artist aspects of a work cannot be said to be conceptually separable from the utilitarian elements. Conversely, where design elements can be identified as reflecting the designer's artistic judgment exercised independently of functional influences, conceptual separability exists." [Source](http://openjurist.org/834/f2d/1142/brandir-international-inc-v-cascade-pacific-lumber-co-l)

So let's break this legalese down. The court has to look at the the work and decide if the work was made for design reasons, or aesthetic reasons. Let's use a plate as an example. There are only so many ways you can make a flat plate. But, you can change the designs on the plate, and those designs can be copyrighted. The world utilitarian means that it was designed to be practical rather that pretty.

Left Shark is probably not be copyrightable because it qualifies as a "useful article". Examples of useful articles are furniture, machines, dinnerware, and most importantly clothing! And since it is a useful article, it cannot be copyrighted. There are so many ways you can make a shark costume. (Like, I don't know, a 3D model?)


#So.... who owns it?
I do not think Katy Perry has any legal claim to the "Left Shark" fad that is going on right now. In addition to these facts, Katy Perry said that because of her contract with the NHL, the NHL had more control over her halftime show than she did.
