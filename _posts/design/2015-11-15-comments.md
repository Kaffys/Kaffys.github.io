Two days before GDC, Valve announced their new VR system, and offered exclusive demos at GDC. I was graced with this opportunity (Thanks Anna!) and I got to see some really cool demos.

The kit that they used at GDC had a lot of wires attached to it. There were three wires leaving the headset, and there were also two controllers which were also wired up. When the kit is released, there will be one wire leaving the headset from the top and going to the PC. The controllers will eventually be wireless. 

One of the really cool things about the VR was the amount of mobility I had throughout the room. I could literally go as long as the wires were. There were two infared censors that you would put in the corners of your room. They were small, about the size as a soda can and are designed to look like speakers. The VR has little censors on it, which the infared censors can look at and determine your location in the room. While you're walking around the room, if you ever get to close to the wall, a small grid overlays the scene you are in, and when you walk away it disappears. It was a very cool non-intrusive way to alert the player that they are in 'danger'.

You were also given two controllers (one for each hand), that resembled the Wii's nunchuck, except instead of a control stick it had the circle touch pad that the Steam controller has. When you were on the home page and holding the controllers and had the VR on, you could see where the controllers were in the virtual world. 

I played a total of three demos. The first demo I played was an underwater scene. You were positioned on the hull of a ship and you could walk around. There were fish floating around which you could shoo away with your controller. A big whale swam by and you could pet it with the controller, and then you felt vibrations from the controller. 

The second demo was 3D light painting, which was the coolest thing I've ever played with. One of your controllers acted as a paint brush, while the other was a palette. You could rotate your hand/the palette on the left to get different brush options. A comparable application is called TiltBrush. You paint, walk around from the behind and see your painting from a different angle. It was very cool, and I could probably play with that application for hours.

The last demo was Portal environment when you were did repairs on a the malfunctioning robot from Portal 2. You got to pick up tools, rotate things, walk around the parts shop, and of course laden with the dark Portal 2 humor you would expect.
