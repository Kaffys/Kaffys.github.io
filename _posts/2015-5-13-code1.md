Splattershmup was an original idea by MAGIC Director, Andy Phelps. Fall 2014, I had the opportunity to take Production Studio, a class offered by RIT, and was able to work as the Associate Producer for the project. 

The original game was produced in Unity, with a team of 15 students from across different disciplines. They were programmers, artists and sound designers. I was the associate producer, so I was responsible for making all of these students work together as a unified team. It was more difficult then I expected. Students aren't the greatest at communicating. We started off using Trello to document issues. It great for the art team, but not the programmers. When they finished an issue, they committed it to Github, and logging onto Trello ended up being an additional step. So for the programmers, we moved to github issues & milestones, while the artists stayed on trello. It was an extra step for me to check both of them, but that's okay, I had a happy team.
