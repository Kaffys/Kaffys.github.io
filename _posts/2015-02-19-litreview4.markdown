#The Gist
Google believes that FOSS is important, so they are allowing users to use their patents assuming they follow the guidelines they posted.

#The Good
- Free or Open Source Software is a very important tool for fostering innovation
- Google and things they own won't sue you
- It allows users to be innovative and use some of Google's many resources  


#The Bad
- legalese is poopy garbage
- no profits, but that's understandable

#The Questions
- What are some examples of people using this?

#Review
It was alright.
