Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.
The Pebble smartwatch was created to redefine what a watch can be. It was one of the first smartwatches in existence. It bridges the gap between the information you can get on a watch vs. a phone.
Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit version? The latest commit version?
The first Kickstarter was launched April 11, 2012, with the first watch being shipped in January, 2013. There was a more recent Kickstarter to fund production of a new version of the watch (Pebble Time), which launched on February 24, 2015. The Pebble Time has not been released yet.
Who approves patches hardware revisions? How many people?
Eric Migicovsky, Founder and CEO of Pebble, and inventor of the watch has a big say. According to the company’s LinkedIn page, Itai Vonshak is the Head of Product, while Mark Solomon is the Head of Industrial Design.
Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted? How many total?
Not applicable.
Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)
The original people are all still at the helm.
Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)
No, although Eric Migicovsky probably won’t step down anytime soon.
Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?
Not applicable.
What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?
Not applicable.
How is the project’s participation trending and why?
Pebble is doing quite swell! The Pebble Time Kickstarter raised about $20 million, which is double the original, which seems to indicate its popularity. Wearables are an exploding technology, which Pebble is a large part of.
In your opinion, does the project pass “The Raptor Test?” (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?
Most likely. Because the concept of a smartwatch is already established and the Pebble has many competitors, neither the Pebble itself, nor smartwatches would be in any danger if Mr. Migicovsky were tragically eaten by a reptile of any sort.
In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?
Possibly. As previously mentioned, the product already physically exists. It would be devastating to lose the CEO and designers, but since it is so popular, and was crowdfunded, others would probably be able to pick up the (time)pieces.
Does the project have an official “on-boarding” process in place? (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc…)
See links to developer resources above.
Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive? Does it include code examples?
See links to developer resources above.
If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?
Well the only real way to contribute would be to fund their next Kickstarter…
Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group? Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?
Ruled by a small group for sure.
Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?
Yes, the innovative mindsets of the Pebble team have given us a cool product which has inspired competition from very large names. Plus, Pebble sounds like a great place to work.
