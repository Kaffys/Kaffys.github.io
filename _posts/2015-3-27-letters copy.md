I'm a TA for Data Structures and Algorithms 1 & 2. DSA1 is composed of Sophomores, and  DSA2 is composed of Juniors and Seniors. These are the classes where students in the Game Design and Development program here at RIT learn C++ for the first time, and then build on those skills in section 2. The students really like this, because part of their graduation requirements is to do 2 co-ops, or internships, within the industry before they graduate. 

The Friday before break, I asked DSA1 these two questions:

1) What is the current day number given the function below:

{% highlight JavaScript %}
function dayNumber(int month, int day, int year)
{

}
{% endhighlight %}

2) Calculate the angle between the two handles of the clock. The angle must less than  180 degrees. 

{% highlight JavaScript %}
function angleBetween(int hour, int minute)
{

}
{% endhighlight %}
