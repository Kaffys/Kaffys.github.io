#Which Entity did your team choose to profile?
Kickstarter

#Description of the Organization?
Kickstarter is an organization which allows people to openly pitch product, project, and business ideas to the world, get funding for their ideas, and give rewards to the people who fund (“back”) the project. The platform also facilitates communication between the creators and backers throughout the development of the project.

#Description of the project?
Kickstarter facilitates its crowdfunding platform through its website, kickstarter.com, through which projects are posted and contributions are accepted. The platform lets creators show assets (images, videos, etc…) related to their project, give information about the planning and timeline, and declare how much funding they need.
All group members assist with research, compilation of information, and presentation production.

#Organization/Project Source Code Repository URL?
Kickstarter
Kickstarter @ Github

#What do you anticipate the easy parts will be?
- Getting information about the website
- Getting information about notable projects
- Getting information about the team behind Kickstarter

#What do you anticipate the hard parts will be?
- Getting information about the organization (financial filings, history, etc…)
- Understanding the relationship between Kickstarter and FOSS/FOSH/Bizleg concepts

#How will you overcome both?
It should easy to overcome any challenges we might face, given the size and relevancy of the organization. Since Kickstarter is pretty much entirely Internet-based, anything we need for the profile should be quite easy to find via the Internet.

#If something goes wrong, what contingencies do you have in place?
Ask for help in IRC.

#When will your group meet regularly outside of class time?
Any day we don’t have class (Monday/Wednesday/Friday), as well as virtually through the internets.
