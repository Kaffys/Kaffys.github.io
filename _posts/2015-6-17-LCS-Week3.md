#NME vs T8
This game is one of Slooshi's final LCS games this season, and he played like it. T8 picked a late game comp, with the Jinx and Hecirim picks. NME had a great engage compisition and could have easily picked away at T8's team. But, NME couldn't commit to engages, which ultimately led to their downfall.

#TSM vs Dig

TSM had the game on the ropes, they had a gold and kill advantage. But once Bjerg and Wildturtl got caught at 42 minutes, Dig was able to clean up the rest of TSM. Helios proved to be a wonderful addition to Dignitas, picking up 8 assists. Dignitas made the big upset this weekend, by defeating TSM. Dignitas is proving to be the team to watch this season, with their run to first place.

#TL vs C9
Sorry, Dig, first place can only last so long. TL cleaned up C9 to tie for first place with Dignitas. First picking Fizz for Balls was not a good decision for C9, it allowed champions like Ekko, Hecarim and LeBlanc to get through for TL.  

#TIP vs TDK
TDK still has a loss of bans because of players with Visa issues. TIP gave TDK 0 room to do anything, with a crushing final score of 18-0 kills, 11-0 towers, and a 20k gold lead. Xiaoweixiao brought out an impressive 8-0-5 on LeBlanc. 

#GV vs CLG
The game started with a beautiful 3 kill advantage at 3 minutes for CLG. GV kept making plays, but they couldn't keep up with Aphromoo's legendary ~~ADC~~ Bard. CLG takes the game.

#C9 vs T8
Slooshi couldn't hit Emperor's Divines. Nien was, again, out of position very often. Porpoise could not find openings to counter gank C9. Team 8 wasn't playing their A game verus the powerhouse C9. But, the throws are always real.  C9's mid game has been lacking and it showed after they got aced at 18 minutes. Team 8 could not take their advantage at and run with it. It's basic math really, Cloud 9 prevailed over Team 8!

#TSM vs TDK

TDK should have been an easy clean up for TSM, but it took a 47 minute drawn out game. TSM has been playing sloppy this season, which is disappointing. Yesterdays loss versus Team Dignitas must be getting to them... But the Ekko win rate continues! Win (barely) by TSM.

#TIP vs TL

Piglet was the true MVP on this game. He brought a bit of Korea with him to NA. He ended the game with a KDA of 1/1/6 with 360 CS. Who needs kills when you get 10 CS a minute? TL picked up Baron, and quickly after that took TIP's Nexus. It's okay Impact, Piglet is there for you.

#DIG vs GV

Keane is learning a thing of two from Faker and playing Jarvan IV in the Mid Line, and the risky move paid off for GV. It's been around a month since Move has joined the ranks of GV, and he is definably making moves (move over Phreak!). Going 1-0-9 as a Jungle Gragas, he dominated vision and helped bot lane push forward for a victory for GV. 

#CLG vs NME

The last match of the day ended on a powerful note. With the game locked with a 9k gold difference, minions at bases, Aphromoo and Polbelter had enough of NME's game. With a beautiful Azir and Bard ult combo, CLG sweeped up NME and ended Week 3 of NA LCS tied for first place. Phreak needs a glass of water ASAP.
