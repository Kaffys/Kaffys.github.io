#The Gist
The book talks about copyright laws when it comes to Free and Open Source Software. There are a ton of different licenses and the book helps the reader understand the differences between each one.  

#The Good
-Explains common licesnes, and what situations I would want to use them, in an easy to understand fashion, especailly for someone who is new to this (me).
-Little bias
-Copyleft. I've heard the phrase before, but never really understood it. 


#The Bad
- I wish we read a more up to date version. The world of software has changed so much over the past 6 years. 

#The Questions
- What legal actions could be taken against someone if they break licenses? 
- When does code become "mine"? When I save it, publish it, or write it?


#Review
This book helped me, as a student being introduced to the FOSS world, understand the differences between licenes. It was an intimidating text at first, especially coming from a legal firm. But if you take your time and truly commit to understanding the text, you will leave enlightened.
