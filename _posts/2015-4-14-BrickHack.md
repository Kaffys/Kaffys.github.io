RIT hosted their first annual Hackathon, titled BrickHack. Although I did not participate as a hacker, I was there as a volunteer. I helped make sure our hackers were happy and fed. 

I also helped organize a minigame of Humans vs Zombies. RIT is home to the second largest game of HvZ, and it was awesome to be able to share some of RIT culture with students from other colleges.
