A few weeks ago, a video with members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) fraternity chanting "there will never be a n*r SAE" went viral. The chapter was located the University of Oklahoma, and was immediately disbanded and removed from the campus and the students in the video were expelled. Those students forgot they were wearing their letters. Once you join an organization, whether you have your letters on or not, you are always representing them. This is true for almost every organization in the world. 

When you join a Greek organization, you join a lineage of people. Every good thing you do as a part of your organization helps being it up. Every inappropriate thing tears your organization down, and may take others with you. But the good thing about this is that you have a huge support network within your organization to help push you to be a better version of yourself. 

I joined a Greek organization in Fall of 2014 because I wanted to help give back to my community, and find a leadership environment that could help further my growth. I found that and so much more. I found lifetime friends, I met some of the most hardworking women that  inspired me in many different ways.
