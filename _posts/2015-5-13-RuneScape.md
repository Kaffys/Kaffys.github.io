I have found myself starting back up the game that inspired me to go into game development. I have found a lot of really cool changes in their game design methodology. One of the big ones is now they're working on monetizing the game. When I originally played, the game was free to play with added content if you paid $5 a month. Now, there are cosmetic items you can purchase with real life money, as well as in game currency and added membership bonuses if you pay more a month. It's interesting to see a game that was so adamant about not having these features, now being implemented. 

In addition, they are working on upgrading their tech. The game is a browser based Java game, and currently they are working on a C++ as well as an HTML5 version. This follows the latest update of Google Chorome and Google stopping support for Nappi plugins (ie Java). The graphics of the game have evolved significantly, which is also really cool to see. With the addition of these new technologies, they are able to introduce new elements into their game. Such as Voice overs on quests, new bloom effects in dungeons and even particles on every item ever!

What's turning into a problem, is that between particles and flashy items, and all of these new and cool cosmetic items, it's turning into a dress up game rather than an adventure game.
