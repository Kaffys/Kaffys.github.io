http://hfoss-ritigm.rhcloud.com/static/books/Weber-SuccessofOpenSource-Chap3.pdf

#When
2004

#The Gist
Talked about how and what Open Source software is. 


#The Good
-"large-scale software engineering to a prehistoric tar pit." made me giggle on the inside when I think about programmers fighting each other.
-Tying in some of the things I learned about GPL in biz&legal into HFOSS.
-8 general principals that capture what people do in Open Source. 


#The Bad
-Too long, lost my interest. 
-Went super in depth on the the nitty gritty when those pages could be used to talk more about the point of the article, What is Open Source?
-Very dense. Would not float in water.


#The Questions
-What are some other early open source projects?
-What are these people/companies doing in todays world?

#Review
It was a very long text. As someone who was already interested in Open Source software, I found a lot of the text a little obvious, and way to detailed. I would not recommended this text to someone who was just getting into Open Source software.
