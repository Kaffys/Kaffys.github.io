#Where

#When
2014

#The Gist
The book talks about copyright laws when it comes to Free and Open Source Software. There are a ton of different licenses and the book helps the reader understand the differences between each one.  

#The Good
- I wrote in a blog post earlier, that I didn't quite understand the difference between copyleft and copyright, and this chapter clarified a lot of it.
- This chapter addresses a lot of misconceptions about the GPL.
- Four Freedoms


#The Bad
- I don't know why I would want to use the GPL and why not.


#The Questions
- "Anti Hacker" movements, and why this would hurt Software Freedom movements?


#Review
As someone who hasn't had any exposure to the GNU GPL, I learned a lot. I learned a lot about copyleft. I would recommend this text to anyone who has not been exposed to these concepts.
