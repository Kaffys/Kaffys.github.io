Over my Spring break, I had the pleasure of having my tonsils removed. I downloaded a bunch of games on my iPhone so I could sit in my hospital bed and entertain myself between naps. One of the games I played was Tap Titans. It's  much like the popular browser game, Cookie Clicker, and just as addicting.

Every time you tap the screen, you deal damage to the monster in front of you. Every 10 monsters theres a boss battle. You start the game off doing one damage per tap, but you can level up your DPS by purchasing upgrades. You can also purchase little heros that will do damage to the monsters while you are away. As of right now, I'm on Stage 79 doing 263 TRILLION points of damage every time I tap the monster. 

What I really like about the game is how they handle their micro-transaction currency. In most games theres a currency you can get in game by playing the game (in this game its coins), and one you can get by spending real life money on (diamonds). It's a pretty common practice, and it's littered in almost any phone application you buy. What makes Tap Titans different is that you can also obtain Diamonds in game.

Every achievement you obtain, you get a certain amount of diamonds relative to how difficult the achievement is. Kill 1 thousand monsters? 15 Diamonds! Reach stage 50? 10 Diamonds! In addition to this, power-ups will randomly drop from the sky. Sometimes they will just give you things like a few Diamonds, 1 billion gold, bonus hero attack speed for x seconds. But, sometimes they will give you increased power-ups if you sit through a 5 second advertisement so you can watch a short ad and get 2 billion gold, of 10 diamonds. These are totally optional! They give you the option to decline the power-up and the advertisement, and keep playing the game, which I thought was pretty cool.
