#TSM vs TDK

#TIP vs TL

Piglet was the true MVP on this game. He brought a bit of Korea with him to NA. He ended the game with a KDA of 1/1/6 with 360 CS. Who needs kills when you get 10 CS a minute? TL picked up Baron, and quickly after that took TIP's Nexus. It's okay Impact, Piglet is there for you.

#DIG vs GV

#CLG vs NME

The last match of the day ended on a powerful note. With the game locked with a 9k gold difference, minions at bases, Aphromoo and Polbelter had enough of NME's game. With a beautiful Azir and Bard ult combo, CLG sweeped up NME and ended Week 3 of NA LCS tied for first place. Phreak needs a glass of water ASAP.
