Legal Primer for FOSS: Chapter 5

#Gist
This chapter gave an  overview of how Trademark law works in the United States.

#Good
- Overview of Trademark Laws
- The difference between ™ and ® is explained, which is something I always struggled with.

#Bad
- Didn't touch on Trademark Law outside of the US
- Spent time on local Trademark Law (instead of national)

#Questions
- Can two products used for different purposes share a trademark?
- Who revokes patents?

#Review
This was one of the better readings from the FOSS Primer. I definitely think that it should be a required reading for all students going into a computing major in college.
