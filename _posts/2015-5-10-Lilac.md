For the 4th year in a row, I attended Rochester Lilac Festival.  It happens every year around when the Lilacs in Highland park bloom. It's a beautiful festival where students, children and parents walk around the park and enjoy the activities there. 

There are a ton of local Rochester vendors, and vendors from really far away. It a really cool way to go out and support our local businesses. There are also a lot of musical performances of local musicians. I was able to enjoy a nice local craft beer, sit outside on a beautiful summer day, and listen to local jazz musicians. It's really a treat, and I would highly encourage anyone who has a couple of free hours to go and check it out. 

I love to bring my camera to the park and take pictures of the flowers. The cover photo above it one that I took at last years festival.
