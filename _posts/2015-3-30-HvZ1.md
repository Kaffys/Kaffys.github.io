I'm the President of RIT's Humans vs Zombies club. We are the second biggest HvZ club in the world, with our biggest game in Fall 2014 with almost 900 players. It's difficult to balance such a large extracurricular with all of my class work, but it's worth it.

We're currently finishing development on iPhone and Android apps so that players can track the game while on their cell phones. Our website is open source and will be available on Github when our game finishes.
