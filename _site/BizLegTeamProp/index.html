<p>Kickstarter</p>

<h1 id="description-of-the-organization">Description of the Organization?</h1>
<p>Kickstarter is an organization which allows people to openly pitch product, project, and business ideas to the world, get funding for their ideas, and give rewards to the people who fund (“back”) the project. The platform also facilitates communication between the creators and backers throughout the development of the project.</p>

<h1 id="description-of-the-project">Description of the project?</h1>
<p>Kickstarter facilitates its crowdfunding platform through its website, kickstarter.com, through which projects are posted and contributions are accepted. The platform lets creators show assets (images, videos, etc…) related to their project, give information about the planning and timeline, and declare how much funding they need.
All group members assist with research, compilation of information, and presentation production.</p>
