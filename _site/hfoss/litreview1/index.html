-Went super in depth on the the nitty gritty when those pages could be used to talk more about the point of the article, What is Open Source?

<h1 id="review">Review</h1>
<p>It was a very long text. As someone who was already interested in Open Source software, I found a lot of the text a little obvious, and way to detailed. I would not recommended this text to someone who was just getting into Open Source software.</p>
