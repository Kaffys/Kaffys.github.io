<p>Team Solo Mid(TSM) and Counter Logic Gaming(CLG) are currently the top two teams Week 4 in the League Championship Series, or LCS. Over the past few years, their rosters have completely changed. But that doesn’t stop the die hard fans from tuning into their streams every Saturday and Sunday night. TSM has the mid lane star Soren “Bjergsen” Bjerg and CLG has the king of the jungle Marcel “Dexter” Feldkamp, both are big names in the League of Legends eSports community.</p>

<p>This week TSM and CLG are playing each other in the final match of the weekend. Both teams are tied for first place, both with a 6-1 record. This game is the highlight of the weekend, Riot Games has brought on an additional caster as well as two former pro players to speak on the analyst desk after the game. But there is more riding on this game then just a first place title…</p>

<p>Two team members HotshotGG from CLG or Reginald from TSM have placed a bet. The loser of the bet will have to dye their hair pink for the remainder of the LCS split. One team will come out on first, one will have beautiful hair. Who will it be?</p>
