        <title>Google Chrome - Stopping support for NPAPI plugins</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite games growing up was RuneScape. I would spend hours running around completing quests and exploring the vast and ever changing world. In the 10+ years that RuneScape has been around, you have been able to play the game right from your browser. No downloads. The game was programmed in Java, which back in 2001 when it was originally released, was awesome. But with the web technologies growing, Java isn’t a viable option anymore. It’s harder to run in a browser, and the performance isn’t getting better. Even today, RuneScape is still mostly written and ran in using Java. Today, that leaves companies like Jagex, the company that develops and supports RuneScape, in a bit of a pickle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly, browsers are starting to phase out Java support by default, starting with Google Chrome. In September 2013, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.chromium.org/2013/09/saying-goodbye-to-our-old-friend-npapi.html&quot;&gt;Chrome announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will be dropping support for the Netscape Plugin Application Programming Interface, or “NPAPI”. NPAPI works by a plugin saying “Hey I handle this type of data!”. NPAPI then streams that data to the plugin, and then the plugin is responsible for processing and rendering the data for the user. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chrome version 42 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromium.org/developers/npapi-deprecation&quot;&gt;launching in April 2015&lt;/a&gt;, and with that NPAPI support will be discontinued and any NPAPI plugins will be unpublished. Some of the plugins that will be affected are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SilverLight&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Google Earth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Java&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Google talk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Facebook Video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So games like RuneScape will no longer be supported in Chrome. Which I think is kind of funny, considering &lt;a href=&quot;http://services.runescape.com/m=news/exclusive-goggles-only-in-chrome&quot;&gt;Jagex teamed up with Google &lt;/a&gt; in December 2011 to make sure the game would run on their browser. #oops&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jagex is exploring other platforms for their game engine. In 2013, Jagex released an HTML5 Beta, which has made significant progress with performance, but not so much graphically. And even then, it is still limited. Right now, &lt;a href=&quot;http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?198,199,113,65596566&quot;&gt;Jagex is developing an engine in C++&lt;/a&gt;, so that they can target multiple platforms and have a better performance for their users. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Humans vs Zombies - 20 days away!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m the President of RIT’s Humans vs Zombies club. We are the second biggest HvZ club in the world, with our biggest game in Fall 2014 with almost 900 players. It’s difficult to balance such a large extracurricular with all of my class work, but it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re currently finishing development on iPhone and Android apps so that players can track the game while on their cell phones. Our website is open source and will be available on Github when our game finishes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Programming Interviews! - Week 1 - Possible Solutions</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote the following answers below. I was allowed to pick whatever programming language I wanted, and I picked Javascript. These may not be completely accurate, and I would love any feedback! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) What is the current day number given the function below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dayNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;month&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;


    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//I populated the last few months with junk data for testing/lazy purposes.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;monthArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;31&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;


    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//This is to check if we have good data. We dont want someone submitting 2/30/15.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;month&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;month&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]){&lt;/span&gt;
       
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//this account for leap year by changing the 2nd data in the month array&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;year&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;monthArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            
            
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//adds the number of days in the month at each space in data to a temp variable&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;tempMonth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;month&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;tempMonth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;monthArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        

        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//adds the days to the temp month &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;days&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;tempMonth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//if its January, subtract the days. &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;month&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;days&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;monthArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
         
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;days&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back on this one, it might have been easier to just break out if int month = 0;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Calculate the angle between the two handles of the clock. The angle must less than  180 degrees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;angleBetween&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;hour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;minute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;hourDegrees&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
   	&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;minuteDegrees&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

   	&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//The hour hand moves 30 degrees every hour, and .5 degrees every minute that passes.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;hourDegrees&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;hour&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;minute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//The minute hand moves 6 degrees for every  minute that passes by&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;minuteDegrees&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;minute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//The two calculations make what each individual angle would be, but we want the angle between the two, so we subtract them.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//The result might be negative if the time is something like 6:04.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;angle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;abs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mintuteDegrees&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;hourDegrees&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//This rejects any answer bigger than 180, and makes it into a number we would like. &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;angle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;180&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;angle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;360&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;angle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;angle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Programming Interviews! - Week 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a TA for Data Structures and Algorithms 1 &amp;amp; 2. DSA1 is composed of Sophomores, and  DSA2 is composed of Juniors and Seniors. These are the classes where students in the Game Design and Development program here at RIT learn C++ for the first time, and then build on those skills in section 2. The students really like this, because part of their graduation requirements is to do 2 co-ops, or internships, within the industry before they graduate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Friday before break, I asked DSA1 these two questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) What is the current day number given the function below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dayNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;month&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Calculate the angle between the two handles of the clock. The angle must less than  180 degrees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;angleBetween&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;hour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;minute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>You Are Always Wearing your Letters.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, a video with members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) fraternity chanting “there will never be a n*r SAE” went viral. The chapter was located the University of Oklahoma, and was immediately disbanded and removed from the campus and the students in the video were expelled. Those students forgot they were wearing their letters. Once you join an organization, whether you have your letters on or not, you are always representing them. This is true for almost every organization in the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you join a Greek organization, you join a lineage of people. Every good thing you do as a part of your organization helps being it up. Every inappropriate thing tears your organization down, and may take others with you. But the good thing about this is that you have a huge support network within your organization to help push you to be a better version of yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined a Greek organization in Fall of 2014 because I wanted to help give back to my community, and find a leadership environment that could help further my growth. I found that and so much more. I found lifetime friends, I met some of the most hardworking women that  inspired me in many different ways.  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tap Titans - Cool Micro-transactions Bro</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over my Spring break, I had the pleasure of having my tonsils removed. I downloaded a bunch of games on my iPhone so I could sit in my hospital bed and entertain myself between naps. One of the games I played was Tap Titans. It’s  much like the popular browser game, Cookie Clicker, and just as addicting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time you tap the screen, you deal damage to the monster in front of you. Every 10 monsters theres a boss battle. You start the game off doing one damage per tap, but you can level up your DPS by purchasing upgrades. You can also purchase little heros that will do damage to the monsters while you are away. As of right now, I’m on Stage 79 doing 263 TRILLION points of damage every time I tap the monster. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I really like about the game is how they handle their micro-transaction currency. In most games theres a currency you can get in game by playing the game (in this game its coins), and one you can get by spending real life money on (diamonds). It’s a pretty common practice, and it’s littered in almost any phone application you buy. What makes Tap Titans different is that you can also obtain Diamonds in game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every achievement you obtain, you get a certain amount of diamonds relative to how difficult the achievement is. Kill 1 thousand monsters? 15 Diamonds! Reach stage 50? 10 Diamonds! In addition to this, power-ups will randomly drop from the sky. Sometimes they will just give you things like a few Diamonds, 1 billion gold, bonus hero attack speed for x seconds. But, sometimes they will give you increased power-ups if you sit through a 5 second advertisement so you can watch a short ad and get 2 billion gold, of 10 diamonds. These are totally optional! They give you the option to decline the power-up and the advertisement, and keep playing the game, which I thought was pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Women in Gaming - GDC 2015</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This year at GDC, many companies tried to open it’s doors for women in gaming. I won along with 19 other women an All-Access pass and an invite to the Women in Gaming Luncheon as well as the night event. Another friend of mine won a similar contest, and another twenty women were able to attend GDC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to meet the other winning students and a lot of great women in the gaming industry.  The talk that stuck out to me the most was #1reasontobe. It started as a response to #1reasonwhy hashtag that started trending on Twitter almost two years ago.  #1reasonwhy was reasons why women are NOT getting involved in the gaming industry. Examples include being treated as “booth babes” at show floors, being discriminated against while at work. #1reasonwhy took off, and shown a negative light on the gaming industry. The girl-power in the room was overwhelming, and I was very happy to be a part of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the #1reasontobe talk, eight women talked about their inspiring experiences in the games industry. Amy Henning, one of the women on the panel, talked about her experience in the games industry versus her former experience in the film industry. She describes her experiences in the past 25 years in the games industry as positive and described the industry as a bastion of opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sela Davis, an RIT graduate working as a software engineer at Microsoft spoke about her battle with impostor syndrome. She encourages people to reach out and support each other, and listen to the support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that I struggled with is peers saying that I’m only getting interviews because I’m a girl, which is certainly not true. I worked hard and studied hard, and I’m happy to prove it to my peers. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Vale VR</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Two days before GDC, Valve announced their new VR system, and offered exclusive demos at GDC. I was graced with this opportunity (Thanks Anna!) and I got to see some really cool demos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kit that they used at GDC had a lot of wires attached to it. There were three wires leaving the headset, and there were also two controllers which were also wired up. When the kit is released, there will be one wire leaving the headset from the top and going to the PC. The controllers will eventually be wireless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the really cool things about the VR was the amount of mobility I had throughout the room. I could literally go as long as the wires were. There were two infared censors that you would put in the corners of your room. They were small, about the size as a soda can and are designed to look like speakers. The VR has little censors on it, which the infared censors can look at and determine your location in the room. While you’re walking around the room, if you ever get to close to the wall, a small grid overlays the scene you are in, and when you walk away it disappears. It was a very cool non-intrusive way to alert the player that they are in ‘danger’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://Kaffys.github.io/images/katievr.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Me with the VR&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were also given two controllers (one for each hand), that resembled the Wii’s nunchuck, except instead of a control stick it had the circle touch pad that the Steam controller has. When you were on the home page and holding the controllers and had the VR on, you could see where the controllers were in the virtual world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played a total of three demos. The first demo I played was an underwater scene. You were positioned on the hull of a ship and you could walk around. There were fish floating around which you could shoo away with your controller. A big whale swam by and you could pet it with the controller, and then you felt vibrations from the controller. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second demo was 3D light painting, which was the coolest thing I’ve ever played with. One of your controllers acted as a paint brush, while the other was a palette. You could rotate your hand/the palette on the left to get different brush options. A comparable application is called TiltBrush. You paint, walk around from the behind and see your painting from a different angle. It was very cool, and I could probably play with that application for hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last demo was Portal environment when you were did repairs on a the malfunctioning robot from Portal 2. You got to pick up tools, rotate things, walk around the parts shop, and of course laden with the dark Portal 2 humor you would expect. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;My smoke test went fine, aside from it being wonky with RIT wifi. It worked fine at home with my wifi.&lt;/p&gt;
