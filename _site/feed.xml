        <title>Women in Gaming - GDC 2015</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This year at GDC, many companies tried to open it’s doors for women in gaming. I won along with 19 other women an All-Access pass and an invite to the Women in Gaming Luncheon as well as the night event. Another friend of mine won a similar contest, and another twenty women were able to attend GDC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to meet the other winning students and a lot of great women in the gaming industry.  The talk that stuck out to me the most was #1reasontobe. It started as a response to #1reasonwhy hashtag that started trending on Twitter almost two years ago.  #1reasonwhy was reasons why women are NOT getting involved in the gaming industry. Examples include being treated as “booth babes” at show floors, being discriminated against while at work. #1reasonwhy took off, and shown a negative light on the gaming industry. The girl-power in the room was overwhelming, and I was very happy to be a part of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the #1reasontobe talk, eight women talked about their inspiring experiences in the games industry. Amy Henning, one of the women on the panel, talked about her experience in the games industry versus her former experience in the film industry. She describes her experiences in the past 25 years in the games industry as positive and described the industry as a bastion of opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sela Davis, an RIT graduate working as a software engineer at Microsoft spoke about her battle with impostor syndrome. She encourages people to reach out and support each other, and listen to the support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that I struggled with is peers saying that I’m only getting interviews because I’m a girl, which is certainly not true. I worked hard and studied hard, and I’m happy to prove it to my peers. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Vale VR</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Two days before GDC, Valve announced their new VR system, and offered exclusive demos at GDC. I was graced with this opportunity (Thanks Anna!) and I got to see some really cool demos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kit that they used at GDC had a lot of wires attached to it. There were three wires leaving the headset, and there were also two controllers which were also wired up. When the kit is released, there will be one wire leaving the headset from the top and going to the PC. The controllers will eventually be wireless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the really cool things about the VR was the amount of mobility I had throughout the room. I could literally go as long as the wires were. There were two infared censors that you would put in the corners of your room. They were small, about the size as a soda can and are designed to look like speakers. The VR has little censors on it, which the infared censors can look at and determine your location in the room. While you’re walking around the room, if you ever get to close to the wall, a small grid overlays the scene you are in, and when you walk away it disappears. It was a very cool non-intrusive way to alert the player that they are in ‘danger’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://Kaffys.github.io/images/katievr.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Me with the VR&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were also given two controllers (one for each hand), that resembled the Wii’s nunchuck, except instead of a control stick it had the circle touch pad that the Steam controller has. When you were on the home page and holding the controllers and had the VR on, you could see where the controllers were in the virtual world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played a total of three demos. The first demo I played was an underwater scene. You were positioned on the hull of a ship and you could walk around. There were fish floating around which you could shoo away with your controller. A big whale swam by and you could pet it with the controller, and then you felt vibrations from the controller. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second demo was 3D light painting, which was the coolest thing I’ve ever played with. One of your controllers acted as a paint brush, while the other was a palette. You could rotate your hand/the palette on the left to get different brush options. A comparable application is called TiltBrush. You paint, walk around from the behind and see your painting from a different angle. It was very cool, and I could probably play with that application for hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last demo was Portal environment when you were did repairs on a the malfunctioning robot from Portal 2. You got to pick up tools, rotate things, walk around the parts shop, and of course laden with the dark Portal 2 humor you would expect. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tap Titans - Cool Micro-transactions Bro</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over my Spring break, I had the pleasure of having my tonsils removed. I downloaded a bunch of games on my iPhone so I could sit in my hospital bed and entertain myself between naps. One of the games I played was Tap Titans. It’s  much like the popular browser game, Cookie Clicker, and just as addicting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time you tap the screen, you deal damage to the monster in front of you. Every 10 monsters theres a boss battle. You start the game off doing one damage per tap, but you can level up your DPS by purchasing upgrades. You can also purchase little heros that will do damage to the monsters while you are away. As of right now, I’m on Stage 79 doing 263 TRILLION points of damage every time I tap the monster. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I really like about the game is how they handle their micro-transaction currency. In most games theres a currency you can get in game by playing the game (in this game its coins), and one you can get by spending real life money on (diamonds). It’s a pretty common practice, and it’s littered in almost any phone application you buy. What makes Tap Titans different is that you can also obtain Diamonds in game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every achievement you obtain, you get a certain amount of diamonds relative to how difficult the achievement is. Kill 1 thousand monsters? 15 Diamonds! Reach stage 50? 10 Diamonds! In addition to this, power-ups will randomly drop from the sky. Sometimes they will just give you things like a few Diamonds, 1 billion gold, bonus hero attack speed for x seconds. But, sometimes they will give you increased power-ups if you sit through a 5 second advertisement so you can watch a short ad and get 2 billion gold, of 10 diamonds. These are totally optional! They give you the option to decline the power-up and the advertisement, and keep playing the game, which I thought was pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;when&quot;&gt;When&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-gist&quot;&gt;The Gist&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google believes that FOSS is important, so they are allowing users to use their patents assuming they follow the guidelines they posted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-good&quot;&gt;The Good&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Free or Open Source Software is a very important tool for fostering innovation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Google and things they own won’t sue you&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It allows users to be innovative and use some of Google’s many resources  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-bad&quot;&gt;The Bad&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;legalese is poopy garbage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no profits, but that’s understandable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-questions&quot;&gt;The Questions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are some examples of people using this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;review&quot;&gt;Review&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was alright. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>TSM vs CLG - Who will have pink hair?</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;tsm-vs-clg---the-rivalry&quot;&gt;TSM vs CLG - The Rivalry&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team Solo Mid(TSM) and Counter Logic Gaming(CLG) are currently the top two teams Week 4 in the League Championship Series, or LCS. Over the past few years, their rosters have completely changed. But that doesn’t stop the die hard fans from tuning into their streams every Saturday and Sunday night. TSM has the mid lane star Soren “Bjergsen” Bjerg and CLG has the king of the jungle Marcel “Dexter” Feldkamp, both are big names in the League of Legends eSports community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;week-4&quot;&gt;Week 4&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week TSM and CLG are playing each other in the final match of the weekend. Both teams are tied for first place, both with a 6-1 record. This game is the highlight of the weekend, Riot Games has brought on an additional caster as well as two former pro players to speak on the analyst desk after the game. But there is more riding on this game then just a first place title…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two team members HotshotGG from CLG or Reginald from TSM have placed a bet. The loser of the bet will have to dye their hair pink for the remainder of the LCS split. One team will come out on first, one will have beautiful hair. Who will it be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-gist&quot;&gt;The Gist&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s terms of service for their customers. Talks a lot about purchases on the iTunes Store and purchasing apple products. These terms of services apply to a majority of the population, sometimes twice over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-good&quot;&gt;The Good&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Families man. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;iOS 8 and/or OS X Yosemite are required to start and join a Family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Families man holy shit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;BY INVITING FAMILY MEMBERS TO JOIN A FAMILY, THE ORGANIZER AGREES THAT ALL FAMILY MEMBER PURCHASES ARE AUTHORIZED BY AND ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ORGANIZER, EVEN IF THE ORGANIZER WAS UNAWARE OF ANY PARTICULAR PURCHASE, IF A FAMILY MEMBER EXCEEDED HIS OR HER AUTHORITY AS GRANTED BY THE ORGANIZER, OR IF MULTIPLE FAMILY MEMBERS PURCHASE THE SAME PRODUCT.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;iTunes will only use your personal information to help you.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Apple will, from time to time, automatically collect information   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-bad&quot;&gt;The Bad&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(iv) You shall be authorized to burn an audio playlist up to seven times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;But what if I’m in two families with 6 people each??!?!? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Apple shall not be responsible for any losses arising out of the unauthorized use of your Account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;:(&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-questions&quot;&gt;The Questions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Families man. Why are they so complicated?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These terms of services affect anyone who owns an iPhone, iPad or an Apple computer. How do these people know what a family is, how many people actually read these things?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;review&quot;&gt;Review&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was alright. I learned some things about my cell phone and my laptop and my tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;who&quot;&gt;Who&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software Freedom Law Center, Free Software Foundation, Bradley M Kuhn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what&quot;&gt;What&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyleft the the GNU General Public License - A Comprehensive Tutorial and Guide. Chapter 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;when&quot;&gt;When&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2014&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-gist&quot;&gt;The Gist&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book talks about copyright laws when it comes to Free and Open Source Software. There are a ton of different licenses and the book helps the reader understand the differences between each one.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-good&quot;&gt;The Good&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wrote in a blog post earlier, that I didn’t quite understand the difference between copyleft and copyright, and this chapter clarified a lot of it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This chapter addresses a lot of misconceptions about the GPL.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Four Freedoms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-bad&quot;&gt;The Bad&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I don’t know why I would want to use the GPL and why not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-questions&quot;&gt;The Questions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Anti Hacker” movements, and why this would hurt Software Freedom movements?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;review&quot;&gt;Review&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who hasn’t had any exposure to the GNU GPL, I learned a lot. I learned a lot about copyleft. I would recommend this text to anyone who has not been exposed to these concepts. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Left Shark - Can he be copyrighted?</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;superb-owl&quot;&gt;Superb Owl&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s Super Bowl was another huge another extravaganza. With advertisements selling for millions of dollars apiece, over 100 million viewers tuning in and (American) football players with millions of dollars worth of contracts and prizes on the line, it’s anything but a minor production. There were many stars of this game, Richard Sherman of the Seattle Seahawks, MVP Tom Brady of the New England Patriots and even the stunning half time performance by pop-singer Katy Perry. But the true star of the game was someone in a giant shark costume. He has been dubbed by his adoring fans as “The Left Shark”, pictured below. The Patriots may have won this years Super Bowl, but the Left Shark will be the real champion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://kaffys.github.io/leftshark.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Left Shark&quot; title=&quot;I&#39;ve always liked Leftie anyway&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are IndieGoGos selling Left Shark costume, valentines day cards to give to your lovers, and of course Left Shark stickers. One of Left Shark’s fans &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shapeways.com/shops/amznfx&quot;&gt;Fernando Sosa&lt;/a&gt; created a beautiful 3D model, and posted is on the website Shapeways, a website where you can buy 3D printed models, so that every fan can have their very own shark. But recently, Shapeways has received a cease and desist letter from Katy Perry’s legal team. Which you can download and read &lt;a href=&quot;http://kaffys.github.io/leftshark.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;can-they-do-this&quot;&gt;Can they do this?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Katy Perry and her team are claiming copyright on the shark costume. Is that within their rights? In addition to that, does Katy Perry even legally own that copyright?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a court case in 1987 called Brandir International, Inc vs Cascade Pacific Lumber Co. Brandir designed an award winning metal bike rack, Cascade began to copy the bike rack, and Brandir sued for copyright infringement. Cascade used the argument that because they were not works of art, they are useful articles and could not be copyrighted. The court ruled that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If design elements reflect a merger of aesthetic and functional considerations, the artist aspects of a work cannot be said to be conceptually separable from the utilitarian elements. Conversely, where design elements can be identified as reflecting the designer’s artistic judgment exercised independently of functional influences, conceptual separability exists.” &lt;a href=&quot;http://openjurist.org/834/f2d/1142/brandir-international-inc-v-cascade-pacific-lumber-co-l&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s break this legalese down. The court has to look at the the work and decide if the work was made for design reasons, or aesthetic reasons. Let’s use a plate as an example. There are only so many ways you can make a flat plate. But, you can change the designs on the plate, and those designs can be copyrighted. The world utilitarian means that it was designed to be practical rather that pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;eli5&quot;&gt;ELI5&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left Shark is probably not be copyrightable because it qualifies as a “useful article”. Examples of useful articles are furniture, machines, dinnerware, and most importantly clothing! And since it is a useful article, it cannot be copyrighted. There are so many ways you can make a shark costume. (Like, I don’t know, a 3D model?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-who-owns-it&quot;&gt;So…. who owns it?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not think Katy Perry has any legal claim to the “Left Shark” fad that is going on right now. In addition to these facts, Katy Perry said that because of her contract with the NHL, the NHL had more control over her halftime show than she did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2004&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-gist&quot;&gt;The Gist&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talked about how and what Open Source software is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-good&quot;&gt;The Good&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-“large-scale software engineering to a prehistoric tar pit.” made me giggle on the inside when I think about programmers fighting each other.
-Tying in some of the things I learned about GPL in biz&amp;amp;legal into HFOSS.
-8 general principals that capture what people do in Open Source. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-bad&quot;&gt;The Bad&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Too long, lost my interest. 
-Went super in depth on the the nitty gritty when those pages could be used to talk more about the point of the article, What is Open Source?
-Very dense. Would not float in water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-questions&quot;&gt;The Questions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-What are some other early open source projects?
-What are these people/companies doing in todays world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;review&quot;&gt;Review&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a very long text. As someone who was already interested in Open Source software, I found a lot of the text a little obvious, and way to detailed. I would not recommended this text to someone who was just getting into Open Source software.&lt;/p&gt;
