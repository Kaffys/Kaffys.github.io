Humans vs Zombies is a week long college game of Nerf Tag. There are two teams, the Humans and the Zombies. The week starts off with ~5 zombies, and over 900 humans. The zombies grow in size by tagging humans, but the humans can defend themselves but shooting their Nerf blasters and stunning the zombie. By the end of the week, the zombie hoard has over 800 members. The game is played 24/7 for a whole week, with daily two hour night missions.

My senior year I served as President. Part of my responsibilities was to manage our [website][1], communicating with RIT administrators, making sure every player is playing as safe as possible and help with writing and balancing missions. 

Every weeknight, there is a two hour night mission. We usually write them a few weeks in advanced, but sometimes the numbers on how many Humans/Zombies are off from what we predicted, so we have to re-write and balance missions on the fly.
