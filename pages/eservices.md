eServices is an RIT web application where parents and student can log on to pay their tuition, add money to their dining services account and check their grades, and much more. In fall 2013 I worked at RIT's Enterprise Web Application team and I helped create the landing page in Drupal as well as helped with the design process for the Java web application. Although this environment was very different than creating a game, I still learned a lot that I can transfer over to the games industry.

I was introduced to the concept of scrum. We held one every morning at the round table in the center of the office. It helped me understand what the other employees were working on, and if any of my work was holding them up. I was also able to float around and pick up on other work and help on other projects if I was interested. I was also responsible for answering trouble tickets and helping maintain the web environment. 

RIT's administrators loves asking students for their opinions. Before we started the project, we surveyed students on what they liked and didn't like about the old system. We also asked what new features they wanted to see in the new system. As a team we were able to break these down. Another thing I did was host a few beta testing sessions to get student feedback on what they liked and didn't like about what we developed.
