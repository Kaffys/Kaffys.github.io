Splattershmup is a shoot'em'up game where the player plays as a spaceship, and everywhere they go they leave a trail of paint behind them. In addition, every time they shoot enemies, or use their power-up weapons, they leave a paint effect on the ground. The goal is the game is to create and share art that mimics Jackson Pollock's unique style of action painting.

Splattershmup started in a class called Production Studio. The goal of the class to was to create a game in an environment that mimicked an actual games studio. We had a class of 15 students, and had a supervising team of 5 full-time RIT faculty members. During this semester long class, I was the associate producer. This is was my first time in a role like that and it was an amazing learning experience. I learned how to manage a team of students, how to lead scrum meetings, how to communicate between a team that. I wrote a post-mortem about my experiences, which can be read here.

During the semester long class, we created the game in Unity using C#. The engine was powerful and helped us achieve all of our goals but one, sharing. We really wanted to create a game that you could share your finished art. So over winter intersession, Andy Phelps, one of our project supervisors, hired me and Liam Middlebrook to explore sharing across different platforms. After our research we found out that it was easiest to share from a JavaScript canvas/WebGL application. So we moved forward and recreated the game from the ground up in JavaScript and WebGL. 

We demo'd this version at GDC 2015, and you can play the game [here][1]!
