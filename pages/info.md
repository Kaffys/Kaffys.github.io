My name is Kathleen, but everyone calls me Katie. I graduate from the Rochester Institute of Technology in May 2015 with a BSc in Game Design and Development. I love keeping myself busy. On top of being a full time student, I'm the President of RIT's Humans vs Zombies club, a Senator for my college's Student Government, a member of the Sorority Sigma Sigma Sigma and Microsoft's Student Partner for RIT. In my free time, I love traveling to warm beaches, drinking new craft beers, traveling to hackathons, and watching my favorite hockey teams, the New York Rangers and the RIT Tigers.
