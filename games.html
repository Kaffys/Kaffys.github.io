                <h4>Associate Producer | <a href="https://splattershmup.rit.edu">splattershmup.rit.edu</a></h4>
                <p>Shoot'em'ups meet Jackson Pollock in this Javascript based game. I worked as the Associate Producer where I was responsible for organizing team meetings, creating dynamic schedules, and pitching the game to our industry guests. At the end of the semester, I was hired to MAGIC Spell Studios to work on polishing and work on integrating Facebook's API, so that the use could share their paintings with their friends. Splattershmup is currently available for both PC and Mac and can also be played in-browser. It has been released in beta by <a href="http://www.magic.rit.edu/studios">MAGIC Spell Studios</a> and is available from the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/splattershmup-a-game-of-art-motion/9nblgggz5zg8">Windows Store</a>. Splattershmup was shown at GDC 2015 by MAGIC Spell Studios, selected to appear in the Indie Games 2015 Exhibit in the Smithsonian Art History Museum, and selected for the The Blank Arcade @ Digra 2015 in Germany.</p>

                <h4>Programmer & Build Master | Release : TBD</h4>
                <p>Mass Magic is a two player board game, where you duel your friends using magical gravity spells. I worked as a general programmer and as the build master for this quick five week project. I was responsible for delivering updated builds with patch notes to the QA team, and creating a detailed and flexible build strategy. We ported this Unity game onto the iPad.</p>

                <h4>President & Game Designer | <a href="http://hvz.rit.edu">hvz.rit.edu</a></h4>
                <p>Humans vs Zombies is a giant game of Nerf tag, taking place on college campuses around the world. RIT has the second largest game in the world, peeking at 900 members in the Fall of 2014. I was responsible for managing the team of moderators, handling external meetings with campus officials, and creating and balancing missions throughout the week. I managed and recruited a team of 30 volunteers to help run this massive week long game. I oversaw the training of these volunteers, and made sure every student participating had a safe (and fun!) time. </p>
